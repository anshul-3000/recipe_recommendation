## 🌟 Project Overview

The *Recipe Recommendation System* allows users to get recipe recommendations based on the ingredients they provide. The project is structured as follows:

- *📊 Data Collection*: Recipes are scraped from the web using the script in the scraping/ folder. This script collects recipe data, including ingredients, preparation methods, and images from multiple sources, saving them in CSV format for further processing.
  
- *🧹 Data Preprocessing*: Raw recipe data is cleaned and processed to generate the recipes_processed.csv file. This involves cleaning ingredient lists, removing duplicates, and converting the data into a format suitable for machine learning, with ingredient vectors created for each recipe.

- *🤖 Model Training*: A machine learning model is trained using the preprocessed data and saved as recipe_recommendation_model.pkl. The model uses cosine similarity to recommend recipes based on ingredient vectors, ensuring relevant and personalized recommendations for the user.

- *🖥️ API*: A Flask-based API serves the recommendations, with routes defined in route.py and served via app.py. The API accepts user input (a list of ingredients) and returns a list of recommended recipes. It processes the input to generate a vector representation and calculates similarity scores to find matching recipes.

- *🌐 Web Interface*: The API is connected to a simple web interface (index.html), where users can input ingredients and get recipe recommendations. The web interface allows for easy interaction with the recommendation system, displaying recipe suggestions.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/anshul-3000/recipe_recommendation
    

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
    cd recipe-recommendation-api
    

3. Install dependencies:
    bash
    pip install -r api/requirements.txt
    

### ▶️ Running the Project

1. *Start the Flask API*:
    bash
    cd api
    python main.py
    

2. *Access the Web Interface*: Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can input your ingredients, and the system will return recipe recommendations.

## 🧪 Testing the API

You can use the testapi.py file to test the Flask API endpoints by running the script. The script sends a POST request with user-provided ingredients to the /api/recommend route and displays the returned recipe recommendations.

### Example usage:

bash
python testapi.py



## 📡 API Example

### Request
Send a POST request to the /api/recommend endpoint with a JSON body containing the list of ingredients:

json
{
  "ingredients": "tomato, cheese, basil"
}


### 🧠 Model Training

To train or retrain the recommendation model:

1. Open models/train_model.ipynb and run all cells to train the model using the preprocessed data (recipes_processed.csv).
2. The trained model will be saved as recipe_recommendation_model.pkl in the models directory.

### 🍴 Scraping Recipes

To scrape new recipes, run the notebook scraping/scrape_recipes.ipynb. This will gather recipe data from the specified sources and save it to the data/raw folder.
