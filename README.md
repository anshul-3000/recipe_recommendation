## 🍽️ Recipe Recommendation System

This repository contains the code and resources for a *Recipe Recommendation System*. The system uses a trained machine learning model to suggest recipes based on user input. The project includes data scraping, preprocessing, model training, and a Flask API to serve recipe recommendations.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The *Recipe Recommendation System* allows users to get recipe recommendations based on the ingredients they provide. The project is structured as follows:

- *📊 Data Collection*: Recipes are scraped from the web using the script in the scraping folder.
- *🧹 Data Preprocessing*: Raw recipe data is cleaned and processed to generate the recipes_processed.csv file.
- *🤖 Model Training*: A machine learning model is trained using the preprocessed data and saved as recipe_recommendation_model.pkl.
- *🖥️ API*: A Flask-based API serves the recommendations, with routes defined in route.py and served via app.py.
- *🌐 Web Interface*: The API is connected to a simple web interface (index.html), where users can input ingredients and get recipe recommendations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/anshul-3000/recipe_recommendation/tree/main
    

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
    cd recipe-recommendation-api
    

3. Install dependencies:
    bash
    pip install -r api/requirements.txt
    

### ▶️ Running the Project

1. *Start the Flask API*:
    bash
    cd api
    python app.py
    

2. *Access the Web Interface*: Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can input your ingredients, and the system will return recipe recommendations.

### 🧠 Model Training

To train or retrain the recommendation model:

1. Open models/train_model.ipynb and run all cells to train the model using the preprocessed data (recipes_processed.csv).
2. The trained model will be saved as recipe_recommendation_model.pkl in the models directory.

### 🍴 Scraping Recipes

To scrape new recipes, run the notebook scraping/scrape_recipes.ipynb. This will gather recipe data from the
